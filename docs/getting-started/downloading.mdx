## SKlauncher Download Issues

If you're unable to download SKlauncher then here are some common issues and their fixes:

### Download button not showing up

The most common reason is that you are using an ad blocker. Disable the ad blocker from the extensions menu and try again. If it still doesn't work, then maybe your internet is slow. Try waiting for up to 10 minutes on the error screen; it should load after that.

### File is getting downloaded as a .html file

The most common reason this happens is due to a download manager. Disable your download manager from the extensions menu and try again. If it still doesn't work, try manually changing the file extension from .html to the correct extension if you know what type of file it should be (e.g., .exe, .pdf, .zip). You can do this by renaming the file description and then downloading it again.
